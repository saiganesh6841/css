        <h1 id="beginning">THE BEGINNING</h1>></h1>
        <p >
            An injured woman is shown emerging from a cave underneath a huge mountain, carrying an infant. She kills two soldiers pursuing her and attempts to cross a raging river, but slips and starts getting washed away by the current. Facing imminent death, she holds the baby aloft and prays to Lord Shiva, explaining that while she doesn't care about her life, the baby, Mahendra Baahubali, must live, for the sake of Mahishmati kingdom, and the waiting baby's mother. She offers her own life as compensation for her sins. The child is saved by the people of the local Amburi tribe, who reside near the river and worship Lord Shiva. The wife of the tribe's chieftain, Sanga, decides to adopt the boy and names him Siva. Siva grows up to be an ambitious and mischievous child, obsessed with ascending the mountain. Despite Sanga's pleas, he tries many times to scale the cliffs but always fails. As a young man, he is shown to possess superhuman strength when he lifts a Lingam of Lord Siva and places it at the foot of the mountain. A mask then falls from the cliffs, and realizing it possesses feminine features, Siva becomes obsessed with finding the owner of the mask. He finally succeeds in scaling the mountain. Upon reaching the top, he sees a dashing warrior girl named Avantika fighting soldiers. He discovers that she is a member of a local resistance group dedicated to overthrowing the tyrannical king Bhallaladeva of the nearby kingdom Mahishmati, and rescuing their captive Princess Devasena. Siva is immediately smitten with Avantika and secretly follows her. When she discovers Siva, she attacks him, but he outmaneuvers her and returns her mask, progressively disrobing her with each step. Realizing he scaled the entire mountain to find her, she reciprocates his feelings and they make love. After discovering Avantika's cause, Siva pledges to rescue Devasena himself and departs for Mahishmati. He infiltrates the royal palace disguised as a soldier and distracts Bhallaladeva and his guards long enough for him to rescue Devasena. Bhallaladeva sends his son, Bhadra, and the royal family's loyal slave general Kattappa to recapture Devasena. In the ensuing fight, Siva beheads Bhadra as both the Amburi tribe and resistance warriors arrive. Kattappa lunges at Siva, but stops short of attacking him upon seeing his face. He falls into submission at Siva's feet, proclaiming him to be "Baahubali". The next morning, Kattappa reveals to Siva that he is actually Mahendra Baahubali, the son of Amarendra Baahubali, a famous invincible warrior prince from Mahishmati, and that the woman who had sacrificed herself to save him was Queen Sivagami, his grandmother. Amarendra Baahubali was born an orphan; his father, King Vikramadeva, died before he was born and his mother died giving birth to him. Bijjaladeva, Vikramadeva's brother and the next in line for the throne, is denied the position due to his scheming nature, and as such Bijjaladeva's wife, Queen Sivagami, assumes power as a caretaker with the intention of raising both her son Bhallaladeva and the orphaned Baahubali in an equal manner to select the next heir to the throne. While the two are raised as brothers and trained rigorously in numerous subjects, Bhallaladeva retains the power-hungry nature of his father while the affable Baahubali becomes beloved by the kingdom.

        <h1 id="conclusion">THE CONCLUSION</h1>
        <p>
           Kattappa continues to narrate how he betrayed and assassinated Amarendra Bahubali. After vanquishing the Kalakeyas, Amarendra is declared as the heir apparent to the throne while Bhallaladeva is announced as the kingdom's future commander-in-chief. Afterwards, Queen Sivagami Devi completes a ritual in which she must walk from the palace to a sacred temple without stopping or hesitating once. She has to do this while balancing an urn of fire on her head, using that urn to burn a demon effigy at her destination. While the ritual is ongoing, a rogue elephant attacks the queen, but Amarendra is able to subdue the creature and prevent it from interfering with Sivagami's path, allowing her to successfully reach the temple and burn the demon. Later, Sivagami sends Amarendra on a tour of the land under disguise with Kattappa for attaining knowledge in political affairs. During the tour, Amarendra witnesses the valour of the neighbouring kingdom Kuntala's Princess Devasena when she resists a group of attackers. Falling in love with her, he approaches her after the fight, posing as a simpleton and Kattappa plays along with him as his uncle. Amarendra is accepted as guard in training under Devasena's maternal cousin Kumara Varma, a coward who pretends to be brave, at the royal palace of Kuntala. Bhallaladeva gets word about Amarendra's acts and upon viewing Devasena's portrait, lusts for her and acquires a promise from Sivagami, who assures Bhallaladeva's marriage with Devasena oblivious to the fact that Amarendra has already fallen in love with her. Sivagami sends an emissary to Kuntala proposing marriage but the emissary portrays it in a patronizing way leaving Devasena enraged. She gives a scathing reply rejecting the proposal and upon receiving her response, Bijjaladeva tricks Sivagami into sending an order to Amarendra that Devasena be brought to Mahishmati as a captive. In Kuntala, an attack by Pindari dacoits on the royal palace exposes Amarendra and Kattappa's bravery and they nullify the attack with assistance from Devasena and Kumara Varma, who overcomes his cowardice with Amarendra's encouragement. Upon being confronted when Amarendra receives the message to capture Devasena, Kattappa reveals that Amarendra is the future king of Mahishmati. Amarendra, promising Devasena that he would protect her honour at any cost, takes her to Mahishmati. In the court, the misunderstanding is brought to light and Sivagami tells Amarendra to choose between the throne and Devasena. Unwilling to break his promise to the princess, he chooses to marry her and serve the kingdom as its commander-in-chief. Bhallaladeva's coronation takes place at a grand note but he seethes with jealousy over Amarendra's popularity among citizens. Devasena soon expects a child and during her baby shower, Bhallaladeva deprives Amarendra of his commander post under pretext of making sure that Amarendra spends most of his time with his pregnant wife and the post is given to court official Sethupathi. Devasena questions the decision, declaring it unfair and confronts Sivagami for her inactions. She asks Amarendra to ascend the throne as a gift to her, leaving everyone stunned by her insolence. During her visit to a temple, Devasena cuts Sethupathi's fingers off with a dagger when he inappropriately gropes women and tries to do the same to her. She is shackled and produced in the court where Amarendra beheads Sethupathi for his misdeeds and as a result, both Devasena and Amarendra are banished from royal palace and decide to live as commoners. As Amarendra's fame does not decrease, Bijjaladeva and Bhallaladeva stage a conspiracy to further turn Sivagami against Amarendra. Bijjaladeva convinces Kumara Varma that Amarendra, Devasena and their unborn baby's lives shall be threatened by Bhallaladeva's evil schemes and manipulates him into entering the palace at stealth of night for assassinating Bhallaladeva to do good. However, Kumara Varma and his companions are defeated and killed. Sivagami, who believes that Kumara Varma is sent by Amarendra for murdering Bhallaladeva secretly passes an order to Kattappa for assassinating Amarendra as declaring it publicly would lead to an internal war. Destined to be bound to the kingdom, Kattappa helplessly lures Amarendra into a secluded place feigning that he is in trouble, before backstabbing and killing him. Bhallaladeva exposes himself to Kattappa as the mastermind behind Amarendra's assassination. Kattappa returns to the palace, angrily blaming Sivagami for her son's death while informing her of Bhallaladeva's treachery. Sivagami collapses onto the floor when she realizes her actions, and Devasena arrives with her newborn son. Sivagami begs for forgiveness from Devasena and declares to the panicked hordes outside the palace that Amarendra died and his son Mahendra Baahubali would ascend the throne. She orders an assembly to punish Bhallaladeva and his father but Bhallaladeva orders the guards to capture her. With Kattapa's help, she flees with the infant boy but falls into a river after being hit by an arrow shot by Bhallaladeva which leads her to a passage that ends down the mountain. Bhallaladeva becomes a tyrannical emperor who holds Devasena prisoner for the next 25 years and destroys Kuntala. In the time she is a prisoner, Devasena prepares a large collection of sticks in the center of the palace, ostensibly as a funeral pyre for herself, but in reality to cremate Bhallaladeva on with the same ritual seen in the beginning of the movie.
